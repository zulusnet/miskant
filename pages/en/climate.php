		<p>Miscanthus is a warmth plant (metabolic pathway of C4) that means a
			particularly effective form of photosynthesis, which provides large
			rise of biomass from the assimilated surface, and is associated with
			the necessity of a good sun exposure.</p>
		<p>Young plants in the first year of vegetation are especially
			sensitive to ground frosts. That is why in some cases there might be
			a necessity to protect the plant (for example by mulching). Later,
			Miscanthus, thanks to the strongly developing root system <strong>is
			resistant for cold , to periodical droughts</strong> and shading trees
			neighborhood. For this reason, it is also possible to use this
			species as an antierosion plant. What to pay attention to in case of
			establishment of plantations is that <strong>Miscantus does not tolerate
			marshes and wetlands</strong>.</p>
