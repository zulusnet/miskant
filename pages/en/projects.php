		<p>We would like to inform that in season 2013 DORAN has completed the
			project related to foundation of pilot plantation of Miscanthus
			giganteus in Ukraine as the first company in Poland. This was carried
			out under the contract with Ukrainian company KSG Agro S.A. listed at
			Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
		<p>The successful implementation of the contract involved the need to
			meet the phytosanitary conditions, obligatory in Ukraine. Therefore,
			the plantation carried out by us has been submitted to detailed
			examination of possibility in occurrence of the following fungal
			diseases and pests:</p>
		<ol class="list square" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0px;">
			<li><strong>Synchytrium endobioticum</strong>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Globodera spp.</strong>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Ditylenchus dipsaci</strong>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Meloidogyne fallax</strong>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Laboratory analysis made by the Regional Plant Health and Seeds
			Inspectorate in Bydgoszcz clearly showed that <strong>the plantation run by
			us is free from the fungi, diseases and pests mentioned above.</strong> Thanks
			to research conducted this year, we can surely offer our seeds to
			foreign clients, with successful guarantee also outside the European
			Union.
