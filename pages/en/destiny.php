		<h1>Miscanthus Giganteus</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p class="after-header">
			Because of the high efficiency (on average about <strong>20 tons of
				biomass from 1 hectare, with humidity around 20%</strong>) the main
			and most widespread use of Miscanthus Giantus, or rather a giant
			miscanthus' straw are widely understood <strong>energy purposes</strong>.
			Miscanthus' biomass can be used for granulation (pelletyzation) or
			direct burning in power plants boilers. The calorific value of such
			fuel is at a level of about <strong>15.5 GJ / Mg</strong>.

		<p>Another, less widespread use of Miscanthus' due to the high content
			of cellulose and lignin, is:</p>

			<li>production of building materials (insulation materials,
				lightweight wall and floor panels, replacement of asbestos),</li>
			<li>in the pulp and paper industry (for production of packaging,
				technical paper, cardboard),</li>
			<li>in agriculture (eg, biodegradable pots and palettes).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Because of the rapidly growing demand for energy the so-called
			renewable sources it is expected to steadily growing interest in
			growing and processing of high-performance plants (such as
			Miscanthus). It is worth mentioning that the basic profile of <a

			a comprehensive technology consulting in the design of lines
			granulating biomass of all kinds.
